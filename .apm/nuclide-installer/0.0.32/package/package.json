Currently, some Atom packages\nhave interdependencies that make this tricky.\n\nFor example, both `nuclide-hg-repository` and `nuclide-remote-projects`\nneed `nuclide-file-tree` to provide their full set of features.\nBecause only one version of an Atom package can be installed at a time,\nit is critical that all three packages are compatible if they are\ninstalled together. Installing the full suite of Nuclide packages ensures this\nis the case.\n\nIn the meantime, Nuclide is committed to reducing the impact of packages\nthat you do not use so they do not add any drag to your Atom usage.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-installer/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-installer#readme","_id":"nuclide-installer@0.0.32","_shasum":"e7a4af4fe7d46e88abeb772a22a2fb49357ba57c","_resolved":"file:../d-115823-53452-140spf3/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115823-53452-140spf3/package.tgz"}
