Follow [these\ninstructions](http://flowtype.org/docs/getting-started.html) to install Flow\nif you do not already have it. Unfortunately Flow currently has [no Windows\nsupport](https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/6), so this package will not\nwork on Windows.\n\nThis is what you need to do to get Flow working on your system:\n\n* Install Flow.\n* Make sure `flow` is on your `$PATH`, or specify the path to the `flow` binary\n  in the settings for this package.\n  * Please note that changes to your `$PATH` made in your `.bashrc` will not be\n    made available to Atom unless you start it from the command line.\n  * In particular, if you unzip the `flow.zip` file to your home directory, you\n    will probably need to explicitly specify the path to the `flow` binary in\n    the settings for the nuclide-flow package.\n  * For some context, this has been a longstanding source of confusion.\n    * Here is a [relevant linter\n      issue](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter/issues/150).\n    * Here is another [solution](http://serverfault.com/a/277034) that allows\n      the `$PATH` to be changed for all applications (launched from the command\n      line and the GUI) in OS X.\n* Create a `.flowconfig` file in the root of your project (this can be empty).\n* Add `/* @flow */` to the top of JavaScript files that you want checked.\n\nVisit the [Flow page](http://flowtype.org/) for more detailed instructions.\n\n# Overview\n\n* Shows Flow errors inline\n* Provides Flow-drive inline autocomplete\n* `cmd-click` on a symbol jumps to its definition\n* Hovering over an expression exposes its type\n\n# Examples\n\nThis package shows Flow errors inline:\n\n![Inline Errors](./images/FlowInlineError.gif)\n\nThis package also integrates click to symbol with Flow, so a `cmd-click` on a\nsymbol will jump to its definition.\n\n![Click to Symbol](./images/FlowClickDefine.gif)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-flow/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-flow#readme","_id":"nuclide-flow@0.0.32","_shasum":"6986414447f497619218d77cc06fedb4542bbafa","_resolved":"file:../d-115823-53452-c3v6sb/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115823-53452-c3v6sb/package.tgz"}
