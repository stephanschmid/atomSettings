We allow you to connect\nto a remote filesystem via SSH using the `nuclide-remote-projects` package.\nThis asynchronously loads and updates from the remote filesystem, even if the\noperations are not directly performed from the file tree UI.\n\nThe file tree also displays version control statuses for Git and Mercurial\nrepositories. Git support for local filesystems is baked into Atom, but we add\nspecial logic to get Mercurial working for local and remote filesystems.\n\n## Re-enable `tree-view`\n\nIn order to use the built-in Atom `tree-view`, disable the `nuclide-file-tree`\npackage in `Settings > Packages`.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-file-tree/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-file-tree#readme","_id":"nuclide-file-tree@0.0.32","_shasum":"f17d8836fbc73624be96ff856516e87232d8f594","_resolved":"file:../d-115823-53452-13536yx/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115823-53452-13536yx/package.tgz"}
