utf-8-validate\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/websockets/utf-8-validate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/websockets/utf-8-validate)\n\nWebSocket connections require extensive UTF-8 validation in order to confirm to\nthe specification. This was unfortunately not possible in JavaScript, hence the\nneed for a binary addon.\n\nAs the module consists of binary components, it should be used an\n`optionalDependency` so when installation fails, it doesn't halt the\ninstallation of your module. There are fallback files available in this\nrepository. See `fallback.js` for the suggest fallback implementation if\ninstallation fails. \n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install utf-8-validate\n```\n\n## API\n\nIn all examples we assume that you've already required the mdoule as\nfollowed:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nvar isValid = require('utf-8-validate').isValidUTF8;\n```\n\nThe module exposes 1 function:\n\n#### isValidUTF8\n\nValidate if the passed in buffer contains valid UTF-8 chars.\n\n```js\nbu.isValidUTF8(buffer);\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"einaros","email":"einaros@gmail.com"},{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"},{"name":"v1","email":"info@3rd-Eden.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-08-21T11:38:43.101Z","created":"2015-01-28T08:38:29.614Z","1.0.0":"2015-01-28T08:38:29.614Z","1.0.1":"2015-01-29T10:05:31.659Z","1.1.0":"2015-05-05T19:37:11.971Z","1.2.0":"2015-08-13T12:14:09.977Z","1.2.1":"2015-08-21T11:38:43.101Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/websockets/utf-8-validate","keywords":["utf-8-validate"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/websockets/utf-8-validate.git"},"author":{"name":"Einar Otto Stangvik","email":"einaros@gmail.com","url":"http://2x.io"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/websockets/utf-8-validate/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"hiwanz":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"E7XYFT7FUBMH6H6XYWMIRAGJ0\""}
