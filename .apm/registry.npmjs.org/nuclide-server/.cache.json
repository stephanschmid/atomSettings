nuclide-server\n\nProvides a collection of services that are run on the Nuclide server to support\nremote file editing.\n\nThis package runs as a Node package to provide the server-side functionality\nrequired by Nuclide to support remote file editing.\n\n## Nuclide Server Prerequisites\n\n* **[Node](https://nodejs.org) v0.12.0 or greater**. There are various installer\nand package options depending on your platform on the\n[nodejs.org site](https://nodejs.org/download/).\n\n* **[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman)**. The Nuclide server\nrequires Watchman to detect file and directory changes. You can build and/or\ninstall Watchman for your server's platform as described\n[here](http://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html#build-install).\n\n* **SSH Daemon**. The Nuclide client connects to the server via SSH, so\nensure that the server exposes an SSH daemon that you can connect to from your\nclient machine, and that you know the credentials required.\n\n## Installing Nuclide Server\n\nEnsure that the Nuclide project is checked out onto the remote server. Run the\nfollowing command from the root of the repository to install Nuclide's server\ndependencies:\n\n```\n./scripts/dev/setup --no-atom\n```\n\nNote that the `--no-atom` flag ensures that only Nuclide's Node packages are\ninstalled on the server, and not those used by the Atom client itself.\n\n## Running Nuclide Server\n\nYou do not need to explicitly start the server since the Nuclide client will attempt to do so when it first connects over SSH, as explained in [Remote Projects README](../remote-projects/README.md).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you want to debug the server starting up, you can of course run the command\ndirectly:\n\n```\n./pkg/nuclide/server/nuclide-start-server\n```\n\nA successful start will display the port upon which the server has started, and\na JSON dump of certificate information:\n\n```\nNuclide started on port 9090.\n{\"workspace\": null, \"ca\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\n...\n```\n\nThe `nuclide-start-server` command also has a useful help option:\n\n```\n./pkg/nuclide/server/nuclide-start-server -h\n```\n\nThis explains many of the other options available, such as timeout, workspace\ndirectory to use and so on.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"fb","email":"poshannessy@fb.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-09-15T17:30:57.372Z","created":"2015-05-22T05:24:41.967Z","0.0.0":"2015-05-22T05:24:41.967Z","0.0.2":"2015-05-31T20:01:39.828Z","0.0.5":"2015-05-31T21:18:27.915Z","0.0.6":"2015-06-01T04:20:29.467Z","0.0.12":"2015-06-10T19:55:39.179Z","0.0.13":"2015-06-10T20:18:35.815Z","0.0.14":"2015-06-10T20:24:07.176Z","0.0.15":"2015-06-15T02:16:13.293Z","0.0.18":"2015-06-22T19:34:33.282Z","0.0.19":"2015-06-23T01:00:26.854Z","0.0.20":"2015-06-23T02:22:41.549Z","0.0.21":"2015-06-23T16:50:47.996Z","0.0.22":"2015-06-26T03:55:15.093Z","0.0.23":"2015-07-06T19:13:40.919Z","0.0.24":"2015-07-06T20:00:21.574Z","0.0.25":"2015-08-02T19:25:22.763Z","0.0.26":"2015-08-03T17:57:33.734Z","0.0.28":"2015-08-06T15:51:41.821Z","0.0.29":"2015-08-06T20:06:29.282Z","0.0.30":"2015-08-07T01:27:52.658Z","0.0.31":"2015-09-15T00:34:13.196Z","0.0.32":"2015-09-15T17:30:57.372Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebook/nuclide","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/facebook/nuclide"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"makenova":true},"license":"SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"3V3R8WXMUIG3DIK4F1YJRRFC\""}
